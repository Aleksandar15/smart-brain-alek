##### -> <a href="https://github.com/Aleksandar15/smart-brain-alek_server">Here</a> is my backend repository.

#### About my Full-Stack Smart Brain App:

I created smart-brain app using ReactJS on the frontend, with NodeJS + ExpressJS library on the backend & PostgreSQL database. While `Clarifai API` is used to detect faces of an image - which then the 'counts' number of total "detected faces" are stored in each user's data.
- *Clarifai API* allows for both image and video recognition, in my code I used it for detecting faces of an image URL link (*) provided in the search field.
  - *URL link has to be correct otherwise its due to fail if Clarifai API can't recognize the image format.
